RFC Memory reduction methods: 
1) CBM reduction
2) Phase table compaction

1.  Possbile CBM reduction methods:
1.1 Last phase: each field value is concretized, rulelist => best-match rule becomes possbile,
    this will reduce the number of CBMs of the last phase a great deal, although it does not
    directly lead to table size reduction in the last phase, it produces a chance for table
    compaction with less CBM ids (and more long-run sequences of identical CBM ids in the table.

1.2 Intermediate phase: there are some chances, e.g., althoug with incomplete information on all
    field values, if the first few rules in a CBM are guaranteed to cover any following rules in
    the subspace at current phase, then the lower-prirority following rules can be safely removed
    from the CBM without affecting correctness, this CBM simplification will reduce CBM numbers,
    and directly leads to phase table size reduction at the next phase. The challenge is how to
    judge the redundancy of the lower-priority rules in a CBM list efficiently. A simple method
    would be: for the rest fields undecided at current phase, if an earlier rule r1 always covers
    a later rule r2 in each of the rest fields, then r2 is redundant and can be removed from the
    CBM rulelist. This is simple and safe, but it is unable to explore more sophiscated chances,
    .e.g, {r1, r2, r3} together formulate a subspace in the rest fields which covers the subspace
    of rule r4. In this case, r4 can also be safely removed, but it is very hard to represent
    the subspace of a set of rules {r1, r2, r3} because it is often irregular spaces.

2.  Possible phase table compaction methods:
2.1 run-length based: a long-run CBM id in the phase table can be compacted with run-length
    reprensentation. The chance can be evaluated to check whether a small portion of CBMs dominate
    in the phase table. The challenge is: current phase table access is based on a very simple index
    function: T_(n+1).cmbid = T1_n.idx * T2_n.size + T2_n.cbmid
    with run-length encoding, a similar simple index function is needed, and space overhead on
    the new phase table structure should be kept low. we can either apply run-length encoding, or
    borrow the idea of multi-level page table sin OS VM management, if long-run CBM id sequence
    are common
2.2 blocking based: for phase tables T1 and T2, divide each table into blocks with fixed-size or
    variable sizes. There are a few possible situations for crossproducting a block B1 in T1 and
    a block B2 in T2:
    a) B1 x B2: a single CBM entry in the next phase table
    b) B1 x B2: each entry in B1 creates the same resulting block B3 in the next phase, and B3 has
                the size of B2 (or less if considered duplicate entries in B3 are possible).
    c) B1 x B2: every entry in B1 creates the same resulting CBM entry in B3, but different B1
                entries create different CBM entries in B3. From another point of view, this is the
		situation in b), where B1 and B2 exchange roles, but the size of the resulting B3
		has the size of B1.
    d) B1 x B2: other situations, where B3 has the size of |B1| x |B2| in the worst case.

=============
Changes for CBM1 * CBM2:
1. CBM1: cbm_id = (cbm-major, cbm-minor)
2. cbm-major fields: major_base, minor_base, minor_low, major_high
